# Other basic tools: stash, merge

## *git stash*

> **1. Checks all the data from the Working Area to the Stash**
>
> **2. Checks out the current commit from the repository, restoring the clean status**

The fourth area where git stores data is the _stash_. Only one command has effect over the stash: `stash`. It's local and doesn't change unless the user wants to.

Suppose you add a new recipe in the `recipes/` folder (say, `guacamole.txt`), stage it with the `add` command but forgot to add it to the `menu.txt` file. You do that, but without staging it:

|**Stash**|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
||**menu.txt** <br>**recipes/guacamole** | menu.txt <br>**recipes/guacamole** | menu.txt <br>recipes |


If you have to work on another branch in the meantime and don't want to lose the work done on the new file when doing `checkout`, you can use `stash`

````
$ git stash --include-untracked
Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: 8438f4e Adds apple pie recipe

````

The option `--include-untracked` also stashes files that haven't been staged yet. _By default `stash` ignores untracked files_.

|**Stash**|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|**menu.txt** <br>**recipes/guacamole**|menu.txt <br>recipes | menu.txt <br>recipes | menu.txt <br>recipes |

You can read the content of the stash with `git stash list`.

In order to retrieve the information stashed, use the command `git stash apply`. This moves data from the stash to the working area and the index. You can give it a name for a specific stashed element, otherwise it takes the last stashed element.

````
$ git stash apply
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   recipes/guacamole.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   menu.txt

````

Now the status is:

|**Stash**|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|**menu.txt** <br>**recipes/guacamole**|**menu.txt** <br>**recipes/guacamole** | menu.txt <br>**recipes/guacamole** | menu.txt <br>recipes |

Once the change has been committed, you can remove the stashed element using `git stash clear`, which empties the stash.

### git stash list

This will list what is in your stash currently

### git stash show -p

Pretty-prints the changes (line by line) currently stashed in the stash stack

## *git merge*

> **Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch**

Suppose you have two different branches, `master` and `tomato`, where the `guacamole.txt` has a different new ingredient ("onion" and "tomato" respectively).

If you want to merge the `tomato` branch to `master`, git will not be able to do it automatically:

````
$ git merge tomato
Auto-merging recipes/guacamole.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in recipes/guacamole.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
````

It says that there are conflicts that need to be resolved manually. In fact, if you get the status:

````
$ git status
On branch master
You have unmerged paths.			---
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")		  |
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)	  |
						---
Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

        both modified:   recipes/guacamole.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
````

It mentions that there are _unmerged paths_. If we inspect the modified file, you can see that git has added the following lines in the file in the working area to reference each branch's version:

````
$ cat recipes/guacamole.txt
Ingredients:
Avocado
Lime juice
Serrano chiles
Cilantro
Salt
Black pepper
<<<<<<< HEAD
Onion
=======
Tomato
>>>>>>> tomato
````

You can abort the merge or fix it manually.

* The section between _HEAD_ and the "====" is the current commit
* The section between _tomato_ and the "====" is the tomato branch

In order to tell git that you solved the conflict (after manipulating the conflicted files), you need to use the index. So you use `add`:

````
$ git add recipes/guacamole.txt
$ git status
git status
On branch master
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.     <=====
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

        modified:   recipes/guacamole.txt
````

* **Note**: The `git merge` command creates files in the `.git/` directory to inform it that a merge is going on: `MERGE_HEAD`,`MERGE_MSG` and `MERGE_MODE`, which contains information about what is being merged. That's how `status` is able to know that the modified files are caused by conflicts in merges.
