# Changing Git History

Changing the last commit is the easiest thing to change in the history. 

## *git commit --amend*

	Adds the new changes to the last commit and allows you to change the commit message

#### Example
suppose a new entry was added to `menu.txt`. After committing you realize that you weren't done because you need to add the recipe for that entry, which is a project's rule. If you don't want to fix this by just committing again (since there would still be a commit with only an entry in the menu without its recipe, which is inconsistent), you can do the following.

```
$ git commit --amend

Adds Caesar Salad [and recipe]

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Tue Nov 27 12:10:45 2018 -0300
#
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   menu.txt
#       modified:   recipes/README.txt
#       new file:   recipes/caesar_salad.txt

[master 443e2a3] Adds Caesar Salad and recipe
 Date: Tue Nov 27 12:10:45 2018 -0300
 3 files changed, 11 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)

```

* **Note**: *Git doesn't change the commit object*, but copies it and adds the new changes to it and makes HEAD point at that new commit now. The old commit, which is pointed by no one now, will eventually be garbage-collected and removed. If you look at the log, you will see the new commit and not the old one anymore.

If you want to change another commit, you'll need more advanced tools.

## *git rebase*

	Reapplies commits on top of another base tip

#### Example
suppose there was a past mistake in an old commit that is not the last one. For instance, some added an item to the menu without its recipe in the `recipes/` folder. There are two of these in our history: Chicken Tikka Masala and Cheesecake. Using git blame over the `menu.txt` you can see which were the commits that altered those lines

```
$ git blame menu.txt
443e2a38 (bliberini 2018-11-27 12:10:45 -0300 1) SPAGHETTI ALLA CARBONARA
443e2a38 (bliberini 2018-11-27 12:10:45 -0300 2) APPLE PIE
fb0c0e9 (bliberini 2018-11-27 12:10:45 -0300 3) CHEESECAKE			<===
e34f8d6 (bliberini 2018-11-27 12:10:45 -0300 4) CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA		<===	
443e2a38 (bliberini 2018-11-27 12:10:45 -0300 5) GUACAMOLE
443e2a38 (bliberini 2018-11-27 12:10:45 -0300 6) Caesar Salad

$ git log --graph --decorate --oneline
* 443e2a3 (HEAD -> master) Adds Caesar Salad and recipe
*   2ebdef6 Merged
|\
| * 07a2975 (tomato) Add tomato to guacamole
* | 269a94f Add onion
|/
* d6a541c Add guacamole
* 8438f4e Adds apple pie recipe
* e34f8d6 Adds Tikka Masala	<=== 
* ae3496d (origin/master origin/HEAD) Merge with remote
* fb0c0e9 First commit		<===
* 1111932 Initial commit

```

Note that one of the commits (`fb0c0e9`) is previous to the last time we communicated with remote (`ae3496d`). That means we can't change it if we follow best practices.

1. We can modify the other commit (`e34f8d6`) so that includes both recipe items.
2. We will change our git history to squash the commits.

In order to change the history, we'll use `git rebase`. We'll use the last commit we share with remote (`ae3496d`).

```
$ git rebase -i origin/master 		<=== equivalent to refering to the last commit that matches remote

pick e34f8d6 Adds Tikka Masala
pick 8438f4e Adds apple pie recipe
pick d6a541c Add guacamole
pick 269a94f Add onion
pick 07a2975 Add tomato to guacamole
pick 443e2a3 Adds Caesar Salad and recipe
pick 6bf7e87 Adds recipe for chicken tikka masala

# Rebase e34f8d6..6bf7e87 onto e34f8d6 (6 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
#	However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
#	
# Note that empty commits are commented out
```

***What the interactive rebase does is write a program, which runs on the current commits in the history and whose output is a brand new history***

The first word in each line of the program is an instruction which tells the program what to do with each commit:

* *pick, p*: use this commit
* *reword, r*: use this commit, but change the commit message
* *squash, s*: use this commit, but mel into previous commit

Initially every commit is "picked", which would mean that git will compose the new history by picking every commit in order, which would result in the same history we have now.

What we want to do is get the latest commit (`6bf7e87`) and put it right after the incorrect one (`e34f8d6`) and *squash* both. This is done by changing the word *pick* with *squash* in commit `6bf7e87`. **This will turn them into one single commit**.

```
pick e34f8d6 Adds Tikka Masala
squash 6bf7e87 Adds recipe for chicken tikka masala
pick 8438f4e Adds apple pie recipe
pick d6a541c Add guacamole
pick 269a94f Add onion
pick 07a2975 Add tomato to guacamole
pick 443e2a3 Adds Caesar Salad and recipe
```

We can also squash the commits regarding guacamole (which involve branching and merging) into a single commit. This can be done by squashing all the commits but the first.

```
pick e34f8d6 Adds Tikka Masala
squash 6bf7e87 Adds recipe for chicken tikka masala
pick 8438f4e Adds apple pie recipe
pick d6a541c Add guacamole
squash 269a94f Add onion
squash 07a2975 Add tomato to guacamole
pick 443e2a3 Adds Caesar Salad and recipe
```

After saving, git will start executing the rebase. When it gets to the first squash, it will prompt the user for information regarding what should be the commit message:

```
# This is a combination of 2 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

Adds Tikka Masala

# This is the commit message #1:

Adds recipe for chicken tikka masala

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#

#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto fb0c0e9
# Last commands done (2 commands done):

# Next commands to do (5 remaining commands):

#
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   menu.txt
#	new file:   recipes/chicken_tikka_masala.txt
#
```

The user can pick which message to use by eliminating the other one. It can also write a different message.

```
# This is a combination of 2 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

Adds Tikka Masala (rebase)

# This is the commit message #1:


# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Author:    bliberini <bliberini@mycomputer>

#

#	new file:   recipes/chicken_tikka_masala.txt
#
```

After this, git will have squashed both commits into a single one with message "Adds Tikka Masala (rebase)" and add it to the history. The next instruction is a *pick*, so git will simply add it to the history (a copy, actually) and continue. Same with the third.

When it gets to the fourth and the two squashes, git will stop the rebase and complain about conflicts, saying that it needs the user to manually merge `recipes/guacamole.txt` because we are now getting rid of the merge commit. We'll need to go through with the merge conflict again.

```
Ingredients:
Avocado
Lime juice
Serrano chiles
Cilantro
Salt
Black pepper
<<<<<<< HEAD
Onion
=======
Tomato
>>>>>>> 07a2975... Add tomato to guacamole
```

After fixing this merge conflict, the rebase can be continued by executing `git add .` and then `git rebase --continue`.

When the conflict is fixed, git will open another prompt to pick the commit message for the squashed commits (we'll pick "Add guacamole").

Finally, git will just pick the next commits as instructed. When this operation is done, the current history will be pointing to the new commit branch and the old history will eventually be picked by the garbage collector.

```
$ git log --oneline --graph --decorate
* 0569750 (HEAD -> master) Adds Caesar Salad and recipe
* 8d598b1 Add guacamole
* 658009e Adds apple pie recipe
* e8cd87c Adds Tikka Masala (rebase)
* fb0c0e9 First commit
* 1111932 Initial commit
```

## *git reflog*

	Shows you the reference log

**Reflog** or reference log is where git logs the movements the user makes between commits (for instance, through checkouts).

#### Example
what happens if, after a rebase, we lose an object that was in one of the commits no longer referenced? For instance, you delete a commit by mistake.

```
$ git reflog
0569750 (HEAD -> master) HEAD@{0}: rebase -i (finish): returning to refs/heads/master
0569750 (HEAD -> master) HEAD@{1}: rebase -i (pick): Adds Caesar Salad and recipe
8d598b1 HEAD@{2}: rebase -i (continue): Add guacamole
2051fcc HEAD@{3}: rebase -i (squash): # This is a combination of 2 commits.
bda57e9 HEAD@{4}: rebase -i (pick): Add guacamole
658009e HEAD@{5}: rebase -i (pick): Adds apple pie recipe
e8cd87c HEAD@{6}: rebase -i (squash): Adds Tikka Masala (rebase)
e34f8d6 HEAD@{7}: rebase -i (start): checkout fb0c0e9
6bf7e87 HEAD@{8}: commit: Adds recipe for chicken tikka masala
443e2a3 HEAD@{9}: commit (amend): Adds Caesar Salad and recipe
0d4933e HEAD@{10}: commit: Adds Caesar Salad
2ebdef6 HEAD@{11}: commit (merge): Merged
269a94f HEAD@{12}: commit: Add onion
...
```

Here it says that the last two changes were the rebase changes. Before that, there were different commits. Some of them are no longer in the history, for instance `0d4933e HEAD@{10}: commit: Adds Caesar Salad` which was amended by the next commit. 

So you can check those commits using the commit's hash or reference shown in `git reflog`. Check `0d4933e`

```
$ git show HEAD@{10}
commit 0d4933eb827c0568c72970c071c216233ad7f4e7
Author: bliberini <bliberini@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Nov 27 12:10:45 2018 -0300

The reflog only tracks local changes. So if the repository is cloned somewhere else, the reflog will be different there.

## *git revert*

	Creates a new commit that undoes the changes done in a specific older commit

It doesn't destroy any objects in the local repository. It does that by creating a new commit.

#### Example
suppose that you have the following history, after committing modifications to add Chicken Tikka Masala to the `menu.txt` file:

```
$ git log --graph --decorate --oneline
* b467bf5 Adds chicken masala
* b6de05d Lisa's first commit
* e34f8d6 Adds Tikka Masala
* fb0c0e9 First commit
* 1111932 Initial commit
```

Commit `b467bf5` doesn't follow the rules of the project in that it added an item to the `menu.txt` without adding the recipe to the `recipes/` folder.

If you choose to delete the invalid entry, you can remove the commit that adds a line in the menu without adding a recipe by using the command ***git revert***. `git revert` creates a new commit automatically that contains changes that reverts what the commit being reversed added.

```
$ git revert b467bf5
Revert "Adds Tikka Masala"

This reverts commit b467bf5492fb6f3a47f3f4aa53218a684f2a237c.

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch lisa
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   menu.txt
#
[lisa 9a6383d] Revert "Adds chicken masala"
 1 file changed, 1 deletion(-)

$ git log --decorate --oneline --graph

* 9a6383d (HEAD -> lisa) Revert "Adds chicken masala"
* b467bf5 Adds chicken masala
* b6de05d Lisa's first commit
* e34f8d6 Adds Tikka Masala
* fb0c0e9 First commit
* 1111932 Initial commit

```

That commit only contains the reverse of the Chicken Tikka Masala commit.

`git revert` changes the data inside the repository's files but it doesn't change the structure of the repository. That is, `revert` removes the data you may have added to the files, but not the commit you added to the branch.

***Warning***: beware of using revert to undo merge commits.
