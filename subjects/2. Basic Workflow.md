# Basic Workflow: add, commit, checkout, branch

## From the Working Area to the Repository 

> **Edit the file --> stage the file --> commit the file**

#### Example

Adding a new line in `menu.txt` changes it in the working area

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|***menu.txt*** <br>recipes | menu.txt <br>recipes | menu.txt <br>recipes|

You can see the difference in `git status`

````
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   menu.txt <--- in color red

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
````

This means the file has been changed but not staged. In order to move it to the index, you need to use `git add`


## *git add*

> **Moves a modified file from the working area to the index, overriden the previous version**

In order to stage the changes in the working area to the index, use the `git add` command:

#### Example

````
$ git add menu.txt
````

Now the new contents of `menu.txt` exist in the index as well

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|***menu.txt*** <br>recipes | ***menu.txt*** <br>recipes | menu.txt <br>recipes|

If you use `git status`, git will tell you the file has been modified *and staged*

````
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   menu.txt <--- in color green
````

Also `git diff` will return nothing because the working directory and the index are the same; however, you can see there's a difference with the repository with this command:

````
$ git diff --cached
diff --git a/menu.txt b/menu.txt
index 1ee7231..e4053e4 100644
--- a/menu.txt
+++ b/menu.txt
@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
Spaghetti alla Carbonara
Apple Pie
Cheesecake
+Chicken Tikka Masala <-- changed.
````

## *git commit*

> **Moves the modified data from the index to the repository**

In order to move it to the repository, it's necessary to use `git commit`

#### Example

Following the previous example

````
$ git commit -m "Adds Tikka Masala"
[master e34f8d6] Adds Tikka Masala
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
````

Now, the modifications are moved to the repository:

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|***menu.txt*** <br>recipes | ***menu.txt*** <br>recipes | ***menu.txt*** <br>recipes|

In this scenario:

````
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

````

Also, there's no difference between the working area and the index, and between the working area and the repository:

````
$ git diff		<-- prints nothing
> git diff --cached	<-- prints nothing
````

This means we are in *the clean state* again.

* **Note**:  `git commit` did not just copied the modified file in the repository, but did other stuff there like:
  * Create a commit object
  * Updated the current branch
  * Etc.

## From Repository to Working Area

> **New data in repository --> Get it to index --> Get it to the working flow**

### *git branch*

> **Shows the branches in the repository**

#### Example

Suppose there's another branch called `lisa`, where the `menu.txt` and `apple_pie.txt` files have different information. You can see the branches with the command `git branch`:

````
$ git branch
lisa
* master
````

And the differences using the `git diff` command like this:

````
$ get diff lisa master
diff --git a/menu.txt b/menu.txt
index 92c4f46..e4053e4 100644
--- a/menu.txt
+++ b/menu.txt

This shows the differences between each branch's versions of `menu.txt` and `apple_pie.txt`.

### *git checkout*

> **It does two things:**
>
> **1. In the *repository*, it moves the HEAD to another branch (changes current commit)**
>
> **2. Takes data from new current commit and copies that data from the repository to the** ***working area*** **and the** ***index***.

#### Example

In order to move from `master` to `lisa`

````
$ git checkout lisa
Switched to branch 'lisa'
````

In this case, what happened is that the HEAD pointer moved from the current *master* commit to the current *lisa* commit. Here, the files are different than the working area and index:

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|menu.txt <br>recipes | menu.txt <br>recipes | *menu.txt* <br>**recipes**|

But it also copies those versions of the files to the *index* and the *working area*:

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|*menu.txt* <br>**recipes** | *menu.txt* <br>**recipes** | *menu.txt* <br>**recipes**|

So now all the areas have the same content, and we are in a clean status:

````
$ git status
On branch lisa
nothing to commit, working tree clean
````

## *git reset*

> **Moves the branch to a specific commit and optionally copies data from the repository to the other areas**

* To understand reset you neet to understand the three main Areas and git **branches**.
* Does different things in different contexts
* **Commands that move branches**:
  * `commit`: creates a new commit and moves the current branch to the new commit
  * `merge`: creates a new commit and moves the current branch to the new commit
  * `rebase`: creates new commit by copying existing commits and moves the current branch to the newest commit
  * `pull`: takes commits from the repository and moves the current branch to the newest commit
  * *others...*

None of them is a specialized operation to move branches. The operation to _explicitly_ move a branch is `reset`

### Options

Depending on the options, after moving the branch to a specific commit, it can do different things to the three main areas

***--hard***

The `reset` copies data from the new commit to the index and working area

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**New Commit**  | **New Commit**  | **New Commit** |

***--mixed***

`reset` copies data from the new commit to the index, but not the working area. Default option

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|_Old Commit_ | **New Commit**  | **New Commit** |

***--soft***

Doesn't move any of the other two areas. Just moves the branch.

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
| _Old Commit_ | _Old Commit_ | **New Commit** |


#### Example

Starting with a clean state, create a new file. For instance `COPYRIGHT`.

In this state, if you check the status:

````
$ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        COPYRIGHT

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)  <--
````

As you can see, the file is marked as **untracked** (the file is in the working area, but not in index nor the repository). If you move it to the index using `git add`, then the status changes:

````
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   COPYRIGHT

````

The file is marked as **new**, which means it's in the index *but not in the repository*. 

If one wants to remove it from the index, but keep it in the working area (for example, because I don't want to commit this file right now, but maybe want to do it later), or if one wants to go back to the original state (no file at all in the working area) one has to use `git reset`.

### Use cases

#### Case 1: Revert the whole project to the state it was before the commit

Suppose the following scenario. The `menu.txt` file is modified with a new dish, `add` and `commit`

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**menu.txt** <br>recipes | **menu.txt** <br>recipes | **menu.txt** <br>recipes |

Then a new file for the recipe is added to the `recipes/` folder, `add` and `commit`

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**menu.txt** <br>**recipes** | **menu.txt** <br>**recipes** | **menu.txt** <br>**recipes** |

At this point, there are two commits that reference this new dish:

````
$  git log
commit 723ad6f2d5bf627c94df78a5b7ab514a1ba39c3e (HEAD -> master)
Author: bliberini <myemail@mysmtp.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 16 12:27:53 2018 -0300

    Add placeholder recipe for squids

commit c65134c2eeb5b007ccedeb527832139ea0d41069
Author: bliberini <myemail@mysmtp.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 16 12:26:51 2018 -0300

    Add strawberry squids to menu
commit 8438f4ecfa6665d4de9f193926840fccd1cc9acc
Author: bliberini <myemail@mysmtp.com>
Date:   Fri Sep 28 16:00:07 2018 -0300

    Adds apple pie recipe
````

But if we want to revert this because the dish is unsuccessful, we need to move two commmits away from it. The last commit without the new dish is `8438f4ecfa6665d4de9f193926840fccd1cc9acc`

To reset the current branch to it, you take the commit's hash and reset it to it (_you only need the first seven characters_):

````
$ git reset 8438f4ec
````

If we want to be in clean status again (not having the new recipe in the working area nor the index), we need to use the flag `--hard`:

````
$ git reset --hard 8438f4e
HEAD is now at 8438f4e Adds apple pie recipe

````

The process `reset` does is:

1. First, it moves the HEAD of the branch to the commit `8438f4e`. This is now the _current_ commit
2. It copies the content of the new current commit to the working area and index.
3. And finally, since two previous commits with the new recipe are _unreachable_ (they have no branch pointing at them), they will eventually be garbage-collected.

#### Case 2: Cleaning the stage file with a *HEAD reset*

Suppose you have modified a file in the working area and have `add`ed the file to the index, leaving it like this:

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**menu.txt** <br>recipes | **menu.txt** <br>recipes | menu.txt <br>recipes |

But you don't want to have the modified version in the index, because you want to commit other files and not the one you just added just now. And at the same time, you don't want to roll-back the work done in that file in your working area: you may want to commit this changes later.

One way is using `git rm --cached`. Another way, as suggested by git when you use `git status`

````
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage) <====

        modified:   menu.txt

````

Using `git reset HEAD` means that the current branch is moved to the current commit by moving HEAD. But by definition, the repository is already pointing at that commit, so it wouldn't change nothing from repository. But by default, `git reset` == `git reset --mixed`, which copies the contents of the files from the repository to index, but not the working area. So `git reset HEAD` will result in the index having the same information as the last commit from the repository, while keeping the working area with the latest changes untouched:

````
$ git reset HEAD
Unstaged changes after reset:
M       menu.txt

bliberini@mycomputer MINGW64 ~/Git (master)
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   menu.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

````

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**menu.txt** <br>recipes | menu.txt <br>recipes | menu.txt <br>recipes |

Now the changes are _unstaged_.

#### Case 3: Cleaning the working area with a *hard HEAD reset*

If you now want to go back to the original state before your changes, you would instead use the argument `--hard`

````
$ git reset HEAD --hard
HEAD is now at 8438f4e Adds apple pie recipe

bliberini@mycomputer MINGW64 ~/Git (master)
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

````

In this case, `reset` also copies the data from the repository to the working area. **It's a dangerous command, since it removes data from the working area**.
