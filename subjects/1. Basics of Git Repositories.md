# Basics of Git Repositories (status, diff)

## Areas

**Working Area**

> **Where you have your current files and folders**

* All the changes done in your computer (its files and folders) happen in the working area
* Once you commit your data, GIT moves it to the repository

**Index**

> **Where you put your files before you commit**

* Stands between the working area to the repository. 
* One moves things between WA and RP through the index
* Sort of like a "Staging area"
* In `.git` there's a binary file called `index` that contains data
* The index has a **status**. For instance, a _clean status_ is when the working area and the repository are alike

**Repository**
	
> **Contains entire history of the project**
    
**Stash**

> **A stack of commits used as temporary saving area**

## Repository Structure

* In your computer, you can find it in the folder `/.git`
* The important data is found under `.git/objects`, where you find *Git Objects*.

### Git Objects

* They are immutable: they can be created and deleted but not changed  
* Types:
  - *Blobs*: represent the contents of a file at some point of the project's history
  - *Trees*: represent folders in the project
  - *Commits*: whenever you do a commit, GIT creates one of these	
* Linked together representing project history: each commit points at blobs and trees (or other commits), and each tree to the blobs it contains
* Objects can be shared between commits.

## Commit
	
> **The basic git object**

* Each commit points at its parent in the history
* When you refer to a commit, you indirectly refer to all its parent commits before it.
* All those commits taken together are a bunch of sequential snapshots: a slice of the project's history
* These references are called ***branches***: a *branch* is a reference to a commit and its parents
* If a branch is deleted, and that branch has commits that are not shared with other branches, GIT will eventually delete those commit objects

### HEAD

* Special pointer, unique, pointing to the current branch. And since a branch points at the current commit, the HEAD is indirectly pointing at the current commit

## Checking the areas: status, diff

### *git status*

> **Gives the status of the index**

#### Example

````
> git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
````

* In this example, there's a file `menu.txt` and a folder `recipes` in the working area that have been committed in the past, so they are also in the repository as blobs or trees (*In the repository* ==> in *the current commit* of the repository)
  * The repository also has commits and other branches.

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|menu.txt <br>recipes | | menu.txt <br>recipes<br>commit<br>commit<br>... |

* Clean status means that *the index contains the same files and folders as the repository* 

|**Working Area**|**Index**|**Repository**|
|:---|:---|:---|
|menu.txt <br>recipes | menu.txt <br>recipes | menu.txt <br>recipes|


### *git diff*

> **Gives the difference between the working area with the index**

#### Example

Both index and repository have the same changes than the working area.

````
> git diff
             <-- empty line, since both have menu.txt and recipes
````

* This is usually not very helpful, as one wants to compare the difference between what you have committed and what there is in the repository. For that, you can use **`git diff --cached`**

````
> git diff --cached
             <-- empty line, since both have menu.txt and recipes
````
